  <p>Fiber’s Impact on Health
  <a href="https://kr.iherb.com/" target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">Fiber can help with health conditions like allergies,</a> <strong>heavy metal <u>toxicity</u></strong>,
  cognitive function, asthma, skin rashes, inflammatory bowel diseases, osteoporosis, and more.
  Because those fruits and veggies are right in our grocery store, though, we often overlook them or take them for granted as medicine.

  If there were a drug that did all of the things that fiber does, I’m convinced it would be a million dollars a dose.
  If you account for the fact that fiber also has very few side effects,
  we’re looking at an incredibly effective, safe, and valuable health intervention that far outpaces any pill we’ve got.</p>
