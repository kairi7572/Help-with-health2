    The benefit of intermittent fasting on weight loss has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials.1 Best results, however, are obtained in people who are also involved in resistance training (e.g., lifting weights or other strength-training) as that has been shown to improve body composition by decreasing fat mass and at least preserving muscle mass during weight loss.2 Intermittent fasting can also improve blood sugar control and cholesterol levels, but a lot depends on the quality of the food choices.3
