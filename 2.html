    The real key to the health benefits of intermittent fasting is what you eat during your eating window. Obviously, it doesn’t work if you binge on excess calories or unhealthy food. If you employ principles of healthful eating during your window then intermittent fasting can be very effective in improving metabolism and promoting weight loss.
